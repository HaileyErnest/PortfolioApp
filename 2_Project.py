But, from 1968 to about 1975 and from about 2000 to 2020 there was a dramatic change in average minimum wage as the South and Midwest regions have the lowest wages, then the West region, and lastly the Northeast region had a very big growth with the highest wages. From the visualization of the box-plot, we found that from 2010 to 2020 there was a large and clear change in the distribution of the minimum wages between the states in each region. Throughout the years, the distribution of minimum wages became more and more varied, with the West region having the largest range and every other region have larger ranges than its previous year.")
